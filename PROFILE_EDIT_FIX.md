# Profile Edit Bug Fix

## Problem
The profile edit page was not properly persisting changes after save due to several issues:

1. **Avatar URL Preservation Issue**: When no new avatar was uploaded, the existing avatar URL was being lost (set to undefined) instead of being preserved.

2. **FormData vs JSON Request Handling**: The API endpoint only handled FormData requests but the frontend was trying to send different content types based on whether a file was uploaded.

3. **Missing Contact Info in Cache**: The Redis cache was not properly storing contact information.

4. **Project Handling Bug**: The API would throw an error if a user had no existing projects.

## Solution

### Frontend Changes (src/app/(dashboard)/profile/edit/page.tsx)

1. **Fixed Avatar URL Preservation**: 
   - When no new avatar file is uploaded, preserve the existing avatar URL from the preview state
   - This ensures users don't lose their current avatar when updating other profile fields

2. **Improved Request Handling**:
   - Send FormData only when a file upload is involved
   - Send regular JSON when no file upload is needed
   - This provides better performance and simpler handling for most profile updates

3. **Better Data Validation**:
   - Added fallback values for all fields to prevent undefined/null issues
   - Ensures all required fields have proper default values

### Backend Changes (src/app/api/user/[id]/route.ts)

1. **Dual Content-Type Support**:
   - Added support for both `multipart/form-data` and `application/json`
   - Automatically detects content type and parses accordingly
   - Maintains backward compatibility

2. **Fixed Project Handling**:
   - Removed the error that was thrown when users had no existing projects
   - Now properly handles empty project arrays

### Cache Changes (src/lib/redis.ts)

1. **Added Contact Info to Cache**:
   - Fixed missing contactInfo field in the Redis cache
   - This ensures contact information is properly cached and retrieved

## Testing the Fix

To test that the fix works:

1. Navigate to the profile edit page (`/profile/edit`)
2. Make changes to any profile fields (name, description, skills, etc.)
3. Save the profile without uploading a new avatar
4. Verify changes are persisted by:
   - Checking the profile page shows updated information
   - Refreshing the edit page shows the saved changes
   - Existing avatar is preserved if no new one was uploaded

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Profile changes should save and persist correctly
- ✅ Existing avatar should be preserved when no new file is uploaded
- ✅ Contact information should be properly cached and retrieved
- ✅ Users with no existing projects can still save their profile
- ✅ All profile fields should maintain their values after save
- ✅ Form submission should work with both file uploads and regular updates
