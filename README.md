## Overview

Hackmate is a swipe-based matchmaking platform designed for founders and builders to meet potential co-founders, collaborators, and indie hackers.

Instead of social media profiles and endless bios, Hackmate focuses on skills, intent, and mutual interest. Users create lightweight profiles, swipe to express interest, and get matched in real time if there is mutual alignment.

The app was built to make collaboration faster and more intentional for startup ecosystems, hackathons, and builder communities.

---

## How It Works

1. Users create a profile with their skills, experience, and goals.
2. The app shows other profiles that can be swiped right (interested) or left (skip).
3. When two users swipe right on each other, they instantly appear in a shared match queue.
4. Matched users can view details and connect immediately.

This approach removes friction from networking by focusing only on aligned intent and relevant skills.

---

## Key Features

* **Swipe-based discovery**: Browse and evaluate potential collaborators quickly.
* **Real-time matches**: Matches appear instantly through a Redis-backed caching layer.
* **Mutual-only visibility**: Users only see interest if it is reciprocated, reducing pressure.
* **Skill-focused profiles**: Profiles highlight what users can do and what they have built.
* **Low-latency infrastructure**: Redis and WebSockets ensure fast responses for swipes and matches.

---

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**

* Next.js for the web application
* Tailwind CSS for styling

**Backend**

* PostgreSQL for structured data
* Redis for real-time caching and match detection

**Infrastructure**

* Vercel for hosting
* Redis running locally via Docker or in the cloud (Upstash, Aiven, etc.)

## Redis Store Design

| Purpose       | Type | Key Format          | Example                          |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Likes Given   | SET  | `likes:<user_id>`   | Used to prevent duplicate swipes |
| Match Queue   | LIST | `matches:<user_id>` | Stores mutual matches            |
| User Profiles | HASH | `user:<user_id>`    | Caches basic profile information |

Other matching logic, such as filtering, exclusions, and scoring, is handled through the backend services.

---

## Local Development Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfordp/hackmate-rework.git
cd hackmate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run Redis locally or connect to a cloud provider:

```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Environment configuration:

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure:

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
DIRECT_URL=your_postgres_direct_connection_string
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
```

## Docker Setup

### Quick Start

#### 1. Build and Run (Production)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### 2. Build and Run (Development with hot reload)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

#### 3. Stop All Services
```bash
docker-compose down
```

#### 4. Stop and Remove Volumes (Clean Slate)
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Services

The Docker setup includes 3 services:

1. **app** - Next.js application (port 3000)
2. **postgres** - PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
3. **redis** - Redis cache (port 6379)

### Environment Variables

Update `.env` file with your Clerk and Cloudinary credentials. The database and Redis URLs are pre-configured for Docker:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://hackmate:hackmate_password@postgres:5432/hackmate?schema=public
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
```

### Database Access

To access PostgreSQL directly:
```bash
docker exec -it hackmate-postgres psql -U hackmate -d hackmate
```

### Redis Access

To access Redis CLI:
```bash
docker exec -it hackmate-redis redis-cli
```

### View Logs

```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f app
docker-compose logs -f postgres
docker-compose logs -f redis
```

### Testing PostgreSQL Connection

#### 1. Check Container Health Status
```bash
# Check all containers are healthy
docker-compose ps

# Check PostgreSQL logs
docker-compose logs postgres

# Check app logs for database connection
docker-compose logs app
```

#### 2. Test PostgreSQL Connection Directly
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL from your host
docker exec -it hackmate-postgres psql -U hackmate -d hackmate -c "SELECT version();"

# Check if database exists
docker exec -it hackmate-postgres psql -U hackmate -c "\l"

# List all tables (after migrations)
docker exec -it hackmate-postgres psql -U hackmate -d hackmate -c "\dt"
```

#### 3. Test via App Health Endpoint
```bash
# Test the health endpoint (checks both DB and Redis)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Or in PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3000/api/health | Select-Object -Expand Content
```

#### 4. Run Prisma Studio (Visual Database Browser)
```bash
# From your host machine (not in container)
npx prisma studio

# Access at http://localhost:5555
```

#### 5. Test Database Operations
```bash
# Enter the app container
docker exec -it hackmate-app sh

# Inside container, test Prisma connection
npx prisma db execute --stdin <<< "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"User\";"

# Check migration status
npx prisma migrate status
```

#### 6. Monitor Real-time Database Activity
```bash
# Watch PostgreSQL activity
docker exec -it hackmate-postgres psql -U hackmate -d hackmate -c "SELECT pid, usename, application_name, client_addr, state, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'hackmate';"
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Port Already in Use
If ports 3000, 5432, or 6379 are already in use, stop the conflicting services or modify the ports in `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is accepting connections
docker exec -it hackmate-postgres pg_isready -U hackmate

# View detailed PostgreSQL logs
docker logs hackmate-postgres -f

# Restart PostgreSQL container
docker-compose restart postgres
```

#### App Can't Connect to Database
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
docker exec -it hackmate-app printenv | grep DATABASE_URL

# Test connection from app container
docker exec -it hackmate-app npx prisma db execute --stdin <<< "SELECT 1;"
```

#### Clean Rebuild
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

## Future Development

Planned features include:

* Role and interest-based filtering (e.g., designer, product, engineering)
* Matching based on timezone and geography
* Project pitch cards and lightweight portfolios
